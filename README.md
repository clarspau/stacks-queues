# **Stacks & Queues Exercises**

This repository is an exercise implementing the two essential data structures - Queues and Stacks.

## Queue Class

The `Queue` class is a representation of a queue data structure with the following methods:

- `enqueue(item)`: Appends an item to the end of the queue.
- `dequeue()`: Retrieves and removes the item from the front of the queue.
- `peek()`: Returns the item at the front of the queue without removing it.
- `is_empty()`: Checks if the queue is currently empty.

Attempting to dequeue from an empty queue will result in an error being raised to handle this case.

## Stack Class

The `Stack` class represents a stack data structure and includes the following methods:

- `push(item)`: Adds an item to the top of the stack.
- `pop()`: Retrieves and removes the item from the top of the stack.
- `peek()`: Returns the item at the top of the stack without removing it.
- `is_empty()`: Checks if the stack is currently empty.

An error will be raised if an attempt is made to pop from an empty stack.

Feel free to utilize these implementations in your projects or explore them to gain a better understanding of queue and stack concepts.
